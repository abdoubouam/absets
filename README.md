<h1>Absets</h1>

ABSets, Abdou Bouam's asset manager, is a personal plugin for blender that I'm making to speed up the workflow.
Currently it's under construction and nothing is implemented yet

main goals are :<ul>
<li>a functionnal asset manager with basic operations (export, import, edit)</li>
<li>automated asset exportation to libraries</li>
<li>main asset types are models with their materials</li>
</ul>
secondary goals :<ul>
<li>full materials with possibility of customization (re-export after tweaks)</li>
<li>possibly become a replacement for "node presets" by Campbell Barton with more features (subcategories, show only compatible nodes...(no compositor node groups inside material editor for example))</li>
<li>light setups and backgrounds</li>
</ul>
